# Azure SCIM Server for OutSystems ODC

This component connects Azure AD (Microsoft Entra) to OutSystems ODC using SCIM 2.0. It runs in the background and handles automatic user provisioning ‚Äî including create, update, and deactivate ‚Äî using the `/Users` and `/ServiceProviderConfig` endpoints.

No UI needed. Just plug it in, configure a few settings, and you're good to go.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Supports SCIM 2.0 operations: `POST /Users`, `PATCH /Users/{id}`, and `GET /ServiceProviderConfig`
- Handles bearer token validation for secure communication from Azure
- Automatically fetches and caches ODC API tokens with auto-refresh
- Stores synced users in `UserExtension` for easy lookup and reduced API calls
- Works with Azure's SCIM protocol, including PATCH operations and `active` flag handling

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install the Component

- Publish the module to your ODC environment.
- Ensure it's reachable via public URL (e.g., `https://<yourenv>.outsystems.app`).

---

### 2. Configure Site Properties

#### Get API Client Credentials

1. Go to your **Users API** app in ODC.
2. Create a new API Client under **Service Center > API Clients**.
3. Copy the `ClientId` and `ClientSecret`.

#### Set the following Site Properties in Service Center:

| Property       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `ClientId`     | ODC API Client ID |
| `ClientSecret` | ODC API Client Secret |
| `SCIMToken`    | Static bearer token Azure will use. Generate one at [generate-random.org](https://generate-random.org/api-token-generator) |

Azure will send the SCIMToken in the Authorization header for every request.

### 3. Set Up Azure Enterprise App

1. In Azure AD, go to **Enterprise Applications** > **+ New Application**
2. Choose **Non-gallery application**, name it (e.g., `ODC SCIM Provisioning`)
3. Go to **Provisioning** tab
4. Set Provisioning Mode to `Automatic`
5. Tenant URL: `https://<yourenv>.outsystems.app/api/scim/v2`
6. Secret Token: Use your `SCIMToken` value

---

### 4. Test Connection

Click **Test Connection** in Azure ‚Äî this should call `/ServiceProviderConfig`. If successful, Azure will allow you to configure mappings.

---

### 5. Attribute Mappings

Default attributes Azure sends:

- `userName`
- `name.givenName`
- `name.familyName`
- `emails[type eq "work"].value`
- `active`

These map to the `UserExtension` entity. No custom mapping needed unless your use case demands it.

---

### 6. Start Provisioning

1. Assign a user to the Enterprise App.
2. Use **Provision on demand** under the Provisioning tab.
3. Search the user and click **Provision** to trigger a sync.

Azure will send a `POST` or `PATCH` request to your `/Users` endpoint. If it works, you can enable full provisioning.

## üß™ Testing

I‚Äôve shared a Postman collection to help test this outside of Azure:

üëâ [https://github.com/michaeldeguzman/ODC](https://github.com/michaeldeguzman/ODC)

SCIM-created users won‚Äôt appear in the ODC Portal‚Äôs Users screen, so it's important to test using Postman or similar tools. You can also check the `UserExtension` entity or call the ODC Identity API to confirm.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Only `/Users` endpoint is supported for now ‚Äî no `/Groups`
- Group provisioning is on the roadmap but not implemented (my Azure free tier doesn‚Äôt support it)
- Bulk operations, `/Schemas`, `/Me` are out of scope for now
